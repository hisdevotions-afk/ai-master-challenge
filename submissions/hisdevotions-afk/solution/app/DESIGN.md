# Design System: Pipeline em Foco

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Editorial Ledger"**

A sales pipeline rendered as a G4-branded business broadsheet, not a SaaS dashboard. A deep-navy structural field (nav rail, table headers, the deal masthead) frames a warm ivory canvas; a serif editorial voice (Libre Caslon Text) carries headlines and one-sentence ledes, while Manrope carries UI chrome and tabular data. The system's single organizing idea is that color is the action queue, not decoration: the same four heraldic hues (gold/burgundy/sage/slate-navy) recur on every score badge, tag, table row-edge, board column and forecast stack so a deal's priority is legible at a glance across every screen it appears on. Gold is spent narrowly — the "Fechar" (close) queue, the brand mark, primary CTAs — so its appearance always means money or the one action to take.

The system supports a light theme (paper/navy/ink, the primary reading mode for daylight pipeline review) and a dark theme (navy-black inversion) via `prefers-color-scheme` with a manual `data-theme="light"` override; every color role is redefined per theme, never computed ad hoc.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Deep navy structural chrome against warm ivory paper — never a dark dashboard shell.
- Four fixed heraldic queue hues (fechar=gold, decidir=burgundy, avancar=sage, prospectar=slate-navy) as the app's only categorical color system.
- Libre Caslon Text serif for all headings and editorial ledes; Manrope sans for every UI control and tabular figure.
- Flat-to-lightly-lifted surfaces: thin warm hairlines and soft ambient shadows, no hard offset shadows.
- A recurring hand-drawn age-ruler SVG as the signature data component.

## Colors

The palette pairs a warm, taupe-tinted neutral scale with a navy structural color and four fixed heraldic accents; no accent is decorative — each maps to exactly one meaning.

### Primary
- **Signature Gold** (`#b8873b`): reserved for the brand mark, the "Fechar" (close) queue, and primary CTA fills (`.btn-gold`). Its scarcity is deliberate — gold on screen means money or the one action to take.
- **Structural Navy** (`#12233c`, deeper rail tone `#1b3251`): the nav rail, table header row, deal masthead, primary button fill, and kanban "aria-current" tab. The app's one dark mass against the paper.

### Secondary
- **Ledger Burgundy** (`#7c332f`, soft tint `#eed9d3`): the "Decidir" (decide) queue — zombie deals stalled past the observed cycle. Never used outside that queue's tag, score ring, row edge and stack segment.

### Tertiary
- **Field Sage** (`#4c6440`, soft tint `#dde4d1`): the "Avançar" (advance) queue — deals still early in the cycle. Also doubles as the "won" state color (`.won`).
- **Slate-Navy** (`#33517d`, soft tint `#d9e2f0`): the "Prospectar" (prospect) queue, and reused as the link/focus-ring color (`--focus`) since it reads as informational rather than actionable.

### Neutral
- **Warm Paper** (`#f3ede0`): page background — ivory, not white or gray.
- **Warm Surface** (`#fffdf8`) / **Surface-2** (`#faf5ea`): card, table and list backgrounds; surface-2 is the hover/alternate tint.
- **Ink** (`#1d2637`): primary text, warmed off-black.
- **Taupe Muted** (`#6a6152`): secondary text, labels, captions — warm-tinted, never neutral gray.
- **Warm Hairline** (`#ddd3bf`) / **Line-Strong** (`#c8bda4`): borders and dividers, both warm-tinted off the paper hue.
- **Warn Terracotta** (`#a4472a`): the sole non-queue semantic color, for data-hygiene flags (missing account, zombie stack).

### Named Rules
**The Color-Is-Queue Rule.** The four heraldic hues (gold/burgundy/sage/slate-navy) are the app's only categorical color system and mean exactly one thing each — fechar/decidir/avancar/prospectar — wherever they appear (score ring, tag, table row-edge, board column border, forecast stack, ruler zone). Never introduce a fifth categorical color or reuse one of the four for an unrelated meaning.
**The Gold-Is-Money Rule.** Signature gold appears only on the brand mark, the Fechar queue, and primary-action fills. It never decorates a neutral element.

## Typography

**Display Font:** Libre Caslon Text (with Georgia, serif fallback)
**Body Font:** Manrope (with system-ui, sans-serif fallback)

**Character:** An editorial serif for narrative moments (headlines, ledes, quote-voice italics) paired with a clean geometric sans for every control, label and number — the broadsheet's masthead against its stat columns.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (700, `clamp(2rem, 1.4rem + 2.4vw, 2.9rem)`, line-height 1.12): page `h1`, one per view.
- **Title** (700, 1.3rem, line-height 1.12): section `h2` (queue heads, board columns), colored by the active queue hue.
- **Lede** (400, 1.25rem, line-height 1.5, Caslon): the one-sentence editorial summary under every page head, max 72ch; `<strong>` inside a lede is set in the fechar hue.
- **Body** (400, 15px/1.55, Manrope, `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`): default running text and all monetary/numeric figures.
- **Label** (700, 0.75–0.8125rem, letter-spacing 0.03–0.06em, uppercase, Manrope): filter labels, table header cells, action-panel eyebrow captions inside `.action h2`.

### Named Rules
**The Two-Voice Rule.** Caslon is reserved for headlines, ledes and quote/italic voice; Manrope carries every other UI surface including all tabular and numeric data. No third display face, no system UI font substitution for either role.

## Layout

A fixed two-column shell: a 244px sticky navy rail (icons, section nav, operator footer) beside a fluid ivory canvas capped at `max-width: 1440px` — wide enough that stat cards, deal lists and tables use a large desktop viewport instead of stranding half the screen as empty paper. Editorial text (`.page-head`, the lede) keeps its own independent `max-width: 72ch` regardless of the canvas width, so prose never stretches uncomfortably even when the structural content around it fills the screen. A sticky, blurred filter strip (region → manager → vendor cascade) sits above the canvas content. Section rhythm steps in large increments (`2.25rem`–`2.75rem` between sections) to read as separated ledger entries rather than a dense grid. Below 860px the rail collapses to a horizontal scrolling top bar, the two-column queue pairing (`queue-pair`) stacks to one column, and the deal-row grid drops its third (fact) column.

## Elevation & Depth

Hybrid: mostly flat, warm-hairline-bordered surfaces (`border: 1px solid var(--line)`) with two soft ambient shadow steps used sparingly for lift on interactive surfaces (cards, the deal-list, the deal masthead) — never a hard offset or neobrutalist shadow.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Ambient small** (`--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(18,35,60,.06), 0 2px 8px rgba(18,35,60,.05)`): resting cards, tables, deal lists.
- **Ambient medium** (`--shadow-md: 0 6px 18px rgba(18,35,60,.10), 0 1px 3px rgba(18,35,60,.07)`): hover lift on buttons and cards, and the deal masthead at rest.

### Named Rules
**The Soft-Lift Rule.** Depth is ambient and directional-light soft, never a hard offset block shadow. Hover states raise `translateY(-1px/-2px)` paired with the medium shadow step; nothing snaps to a harsh silhouette.

## Shapes

Small, consistent corner radii throughout: `5px` (buttons, inputs, tags' pill uses `999px`), `12px` (cards, lists, tables, action panels), `16px` (the deal masthead, the largest single surface). Borders are 1px warm hairlines; no heavy strokes. The recurring signature geometry is the age-ruler: a thin horizontal three-zone bar (avançar/fechar/decidir tint bands) with a navy tick marking the deal's position — it appears at three sizes (row-inline, board-card, deal-page-large) and is the one custom visual motif that repeats app-wide, alongside the brand mark: a supplied bronze armillary-sphere emblem (`src/assets/logo-mark.png`, 32px, background keyed to transparent so it sits directly on navy with no visible box).

## Components

### Buttons
- **Shape:** small radius (`5px`), inline-flex, bold label weight.
- **Primary** (`.btn`): navy fill, warm off-white text (`#f6f1e6`), `0.5rem 1rem` padding, ambient-sm shadow at rest.
- **Gold** (`.btn-gold`): gold fill, near-black text (`#211603`) for the close-queue and money-adjacent CTA.
- **Quiet** (`.btn-quiet`): surface fill with an inset 1px line-strong ring instead of a border — used for secondary actions ("Encerrar como perdido").
- **Link** (`.btn-link`): no background, slate-navy text, underline, used for low-emphasis actions ("Limpar filtros", "Desfazer").
- **Hover / Focus:** all buttons lift `translateY(-1px)` and step up to the medium shadow on hover; `:focus-visible` gets a 2px slate-navy outline app-wide.

### Chips (Tags)
- **Style:** pill radius (`999px`), each queue's soft tint as background with its saturated hue as text, uppercase, 700 weight, 0.75rem.
- **State:** no selected/unselected variant — a tag is a fixed queue label, not a toggle.

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** `12px` for lists/cards, `16px` for the deal masthead.
- **Background:** warm surface (`#fffdf8`) on paper.
- **Shadow Strategy:** ambient-sm at rest, ambient-md on hover (see Elevation).
- **Border:** 1px warm hairline (`var(--line)`); the kanban card additionally tints its border toward the active queue hue on hover.
- **Internal Padding:** `0.85rem–1.6rem` depending on density (compact deal-row vs. the deal masthead).

### Stat Cards (Meu dia KPI row)
Three cards in a row (`.stat-row`, stacks on mobile): uppercase label + circular gold-on-`fechar-soft` icon badge, a bold 1.6rem number, then a thin gold-on-`line` progress bar and a muted caption stating the real ratio behind it (e.g. "14% do pipeline declarado (US$ 5 mi)"). Every ratio is computed from the same scoped-open data as the rest of the app — never an invented comparison like "12% acima da meta".

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** warm surface background, 1px `line-strong` border, `5px` radius, custom double-chevron select arrow drawn in CSS gradients (no native OS arrow, no icon font).
- **Focus:** border shifts to slate-navy plus a 3px soft slate-navy glow ring, no default outline.

### Navigation
- **Style:** navy rail, links in translucent warm-white text stepping to full white on hover/active; the active link carries a 3px gold tick on its leading edge (rotates to a bottom tick on the mobile horizontal rail). Each link carries a one-stroke SVG icon (17px, same stroke language as the reason icons) before its label. A "Workspace" micro-label sits above the list (hidden on the mobile horizontal rail, where it has no room to mean anything). Section headings above rows are Caslon-serif and colored by their queue.
- **Operator footer:** pinned at the bottom of the rail — a gold initials avatar plus the current filter scope's name (vendor/manager/region, or "Toda a equipe"), the same source of truth as `MyDay`'s "Bom dia, {agent}", never a fabricated logged-in identity. The "Dados até…" reference-date line sits beneath it. Hidden on mobile (no room in the horizontal rail).

### Topbar (system chrome)
A persistent 60px navy bar above the sidebar and canvas (52px on mobile), carrying the account identity rather than just the product name: the compass mark + "G4" wordmark (the real, repo-confirmed brand), a divider, then "Pipeline em Foco" as the product name. A translucent-navy global search (`.topbar-search`, `color-mix(in srgb, white 10%, var(--navy))`) routes to Pipeline's own search via a `busca` query param — real filtering, not decorative chrome. A bell icon shows a live, filter-scoped count of deals in the "decidir" queue (gold pill badge, capped at "99+"). An outlined gold "Exportar" button generates a real CSV of the current filter scope (`.topbar-export`) — a tangible action a sales manager would actually use, not a decorative CTA. On mobile the search and product-name label collapse; brand, bell and export stay.

### Tables
The `.deals` table's first column (`Deal`) is `position: sticky; left: 0` with its own background — once a table grows wide enough to need horizontal scroll (Pipeline's table has 8 columns including "Próxima ação"), the one column that says *which deal this is* never scrolls out of view, the same convention any real spreadsheet or CRM grid uses. The queue-colored left accent bar and the sticky column's own edge-hairline compose into one `box-shadow` list rather than fighting each other. "Próxima ação" reuses the engine's own `action` sentence (never new copy), truncated to one line with a small arrow-link icon.

### The Age Ruler (signature component)
A thin, three-zone horizontal bar (SVG rects tinted from each queue's hue) with a navy marker tick showing where a deal sits against the observed sales-cycle distribution. Appears inline (`ruler-sm`, 9px tall) in every deal row and board card, and large (`ruler-lg`, 16px, with axis ticks) on the deal page and the win-curve chart. It is the one component every list, board and deal page shares, and is the app's most-repeated custom visual idiom.

**Exception — the "Decida o destino" queue.** Every deal in this queue is a zombie: score is always 0 and the ruler's marker always sits pinned past its right edge. Repeating a badge and a bar that never vary carries no information, so this one queue swaps them for `StalledRow`: the score circle becomes a decidir-tinted badge showing the actual day count (the number that varies and matters), and the ruler becomes the deal's declared value with a "no forecast declarado" caption — the same key `ORDER.decidir` already sorts this queue by. Pipeline's table and board still show the ordinary Score + Ruler for decidir-bucket deals, because there they sit beside every other bucket and the contrast (0 among 40–100s, pinned among varied positions) is itself the signal.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** keep gold spent only on the Fechar queue, the brand mark, and primary CTAs (The Gold-Is-Money Rule).
- **Do** pair Caslon headlines/ledes with Manrope for every control and number (The Two-Voice Rule).
- **Do** draw icons (age-ruler, sort indicators, back chevron, reason markers, nav icons) as inline SVG in one consistent stroke weight — never a unicode glyph or icon font. The brand mark is the one exception: a real supplied raster asset, not drawn — see Cards/Navigation above.
- **Do** keep depth ambient and soft (The Soft-Lift Rule); reserve shadow escalation for hover/interactive state, not resting decoration.
- **Do** carry the four heraldic queue hues identically across every surface a deal's status appears on (score, tag, row edge, board column, stack, ruler zone).

### Don't:
- **Don't** add a kicker/eyebrow label floating above a page or section heading; the built system folds context (like a dateline) into the lede's own prose sentence instead. This is a defect the finish review removed from one page, not a pattern to reintroduce.
- **Don't** introduce a fifth categorical color, or reuse a queue hue for a meaning outside its queue.
- **Don't** use hard-edged offset shadows (neobrutalist block shadows); this world's depth is ambient-soft only.
- **Don't** substitute a system display face for Libre Caslon Text in headline/lede roles, or a system sans for Manrope in UI/data roles.
